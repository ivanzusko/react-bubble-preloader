## Customization
All props are not required, only if you want to customize:

Property | Type | Description
:---|:---|:---
`animation` | object | with `speed` key
`bubble` | object | with `width` and `height` keys, which accept any kind of size units
`className` | string | you can pass your custom class to the preloader, but bubbles still will have classes `bubble1` , `bubble2` , `bubble3`
`color` | array | which accepts three colors which will be used one by one as background colors of the bubbles
`style` | object | which accepts normal object with styles as it could be done with normal DOM elements.
